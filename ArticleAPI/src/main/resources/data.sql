We were watching the movie and the oven beeped so the pizza was done. He looked me dead in the eye and said, "This is the worst part." I then watched this boy open the oven and pull the pizza out with his bare hands, rack and all, screaming at the top of his lungs.

I forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got it before I could intercept with my fake. She was PISSED—at the school for their error. The teacher also retired that year and had already thrown out his records, so they had to take my mothers "proof" (the fake ones I made throughout the year) and "correct" the "mistake."

And if you forgot your password, a security question you could choose was "What is your eye color?" and if you got it right itd tell you your password. So I would go to popular locations in Nicktropolis and write down random usernames who were also in those areas, and then I would log out and type in the username as if it were my own and see which of these usernames had a security question set to "What is your eye color?" (Which was most of them, since it was easy and we were all kids). I would then try either brown, blue, or green, and always get in, then I would go to their house and send all of their furniture and decorations to my own accounts.

None of us were sure if it was the fire alarm or the lockdown alarm, so we all head out into the hall to check and no ones out there, so we head back in and climb under our desks as is lockdown procedure. Cut to an hour or so later when a teacher bursts in and nearly dies of relief because the school was on fire and we were the only students not accounted for and half the faculty and fire department had been searching for us for ages.

I could hear it over my music but ignored it. My teacher thought it was me. So he comes up to me & ripped my BRAND NEW Apple headphones, looking ruthless.

    ('Julius Caesar', 'When I was in high school, I was pretty quiet around people who werent my friends. The high schools wrestling coach also taught geometry, and he was my teacher. This resulted in a lot of wrestlers skipping class and barging into our classroom to hang out and not get in trouble. One day, seven wrestlers come in yelling about new wrestling uniforms, and how excited they were. When they go over and pull out the uniforms, the whole class is kind of side eyeing them. Even without what I mention next, the suits look funny. I mean, its tight royal blue Spandex with a suspender style top. Absolutely funny already. But the wrestlers grab the uniforms and rush out of the room to go change in the bathroom, and come back to show them off. Which, is also hysterical because Spandex hides NOTHING; you could see all of their junk. Anyway, we live in a town called Ocean City. Its commonly abbreviated as "OC". On the back of the Spandex uniform, it says Ocean City Men in large letters. Except… they used the abbreviation. On the back, it says OC MEN. Which isnt awful, but then I sound it out in my head. OC MEN. Oh—semen. I almost spit out the water I was drinking. I looked around frantically, trying to find out who I can tell, because I didnt have any friends to tell in this class. I turn to the girl next to me, and I had no idea who she was and had never talked to her before. I told her what I found and we both cracked up. The whole time she saw me as the quiet teachers pet who was shy as hell. The first words out of my mouth were "It says oh semen." Weve been best friends for 7 years now.', '2022-11-28 21:02:44', 'Oh—semen'),
    ('Napoleon Bonaparte', 'When I was a kid, I was always excited to learn new vocabulary. When I was in first grade, my teacher taught me that "shin" was another word for leg. Later that day, I was walking with my mom, when I tripped and hit my leg on the ground really hard. I yelled out "OW, MY SHIN" although my mom heard "OW, MY SHIT." She started yelling about how that was a bad word and we didnt say that word, and she was going to wash my mouth out with soap. I was a crying, bawling mess of a child, to the point I was doing that weird cry, stutter, hiccup noise. She paused in berating me and said "Who taught you that word?!" Of course, I told the truth and said "M-m-my teacher t-t-t-taught me that word!" and she started ranting about how she was going to call the school and get that teacher yelled at. I tried to explain, "T-te-teacher said that shin meant leg Im SO SORRY ILL N-N-NE-ne-never say it again." My mom got quiet and realized her mistake. "…What did you say?" Of course I started crying harder and I said "NO its just a test youre going to wash my mouth out with soap again." When I finally calmed down enough to say it again, my mom apologized and to this day I always say "shin" loudly just to see her face blush.', '2022-11-29 19:08:06', 'Ow, my shit!'),
    ('Napoleon Bonaparte', 'I have a friend who Ive known since I was very little. One day, when he was six, I was at his house when he got this absolutely god-awful stomach pain. I mean, he was literally writhing in pain. So, his mom took him to the doctors office, where the doctor took one look and told her to take him to the ER. She feared something along the lines of an intestinal rupture. About half way to the hospital, my friend suddenly let rip the loudest, most powerful fart any of us had ever heard. I swear to God he levitated. We thought the upholstery in the car seat had ripped. After a good 30 seconds of intense farting, he looked at his mom and said, "I feel all better now!"', '2022-11-29 22:15:24', 'I swear to God he levitated'),
    ('Julius Caesar', 'So a couple years I moved out of state with a boyfriend. Was super excited about it but with reason had anxiety about being so far from friends and family. One of the ways my anxiety was coming out was with nightmares and night terrors. Id wake up violently sitting up in a cold sweat, gasping and whatnot. On one particular night I had woken up the sound of our doorbell ringing. Which at 4 in the morning is fucking nerve wracking. So I shook my boyfriend fully awake and told him I heard the doorbell and to go check it because I was scared. He quickly jumps up. Puts on clothes and grabs a bat. Goes all the way to the front door and opens it. I, scared shitless, am peeking around the corner watching it all go down. I see him step outside and I nervously await the verdict of the situation when I hear him call out to me. "Babe?" And I respond real shaky, "Yes?"

    ('Julius Caesar', 'In second grade, I told everyone that I was leaving school before next semester to move to Hollywood to play Megans cousin from Vermont on Drake and Josh. At first I just told my best friend, but then the whole school found out. I had people coming up to me and asking me for my autograph and a teacher even asked for a picture with me. When I showed up on the first day of school in third grade, I told everyone that the show was going off the air after the season finished (even though I had no knowledge of when it was ending), and so they wouldnt need me. AND THE SHOW ENDED AFTER THAT SEASON AND EVERYONE BELIEVED ME UP UNTIL LIKE 6TH GRADE BUT NOW MY BEST FRIEND WILL NEVER LET ME FORGET ABOUT IT AND IM SO ANGRY.', '2022-11-30 12:07:02', 'The whole school thought I was going to star on Drake and Josh'),
    ('Suleiman the Magnificent', 'So in 8th grade I used to read during class a lot. At the time I was reading an Artemis Fowl book, and for some reason I had two copies of the same book. So one day in my English class we were reading this other book (which I had already finished reading three days earlier), I was reading my own book and when it was finally my turn to read, I had no idea where we were. So the teacher took my book away, I found my spot, read the part and passed it to the next person to start reading. So after I read my part, I took out my second copy of Artemis and picked up right where I left off. Skip a few minutes ahead, gets back to my turn to read, and again I dont know where we are. So teacher takes a look at me, sees the book in my hands, then back to her desk obviously confused for a second. But shrugs it off knowing its me shes dealing with (Ive caused similar problems like this before), takes my second book and puts it on her desk, and makes me read my part. Now my friend that sat two chairs down from me was also reading Artemis at the same time as me and with a quick look to him he knew exactly what I was planning. He took it out and passed it over without hesitation. I opened to a random spot and just pretended like I was reading. (At this point it was just to mess with my teacher.) So skip forward again and my teacher sees me with the book again and says, "How many of those do you have?" I gave my smartass remark as "enough." She took away that book, too. But now at this point I was out of books, and the rest of my class knew it. But the teacher didnt know I was out. So she continued with her lesson and another friend of mine took two of her books and switched out two of the Artemis books on her desk to make them look like they were still there. He passed the books slowly around the room, one at a time, until they were back to me. Then I took one out, opened to a random spot and just kept it open, waiting to get caught. I silently signaled to a few people in class and they started laughing. The teacher looked at what they were laughing at and saw me with yet another book. She looked at her desk where there were seemingly 3 Artemis books and saw me with a 4th. She took it, walked back to her desk, put it down, turned around, and saw me with the second book that got taken back on my desk!!! The teacher thought she was going to win this game but underestimated my teamwork with my classmates. So the second she came over to me to take the seemingly 5th book, another classmate took back the other two books from her desk and split them up—sending one to me one way, and the other another way. The teacher was very flustered and laughing hysterically at this point and there was no more teaching going on. The entire class was also going ballistic trying to see who would win. It was just a game of "How many books does this one 8th grader have?" So at the end of the class she thought she had taken 11 books from me. I took pity on her and told her what was really happening. I told her that I had already read the first book, and all the teamwork that went on. We were both laughing and making jokes. In the end she agreed to let me read my own books as long as I kept track of the actual book we were reading. (Meaning, I ask the person next to me tell me when its my turn and they point out my spot to read so I dont actually have to keep track.)', '2022-11-30 21:51:11', 'Classroom Chaos'),

My younger brother Eric asks if he can take off his pants too and Ethan says yeah, just make sure you have clean underwear on. Eric leaves the room, goes upstairs, comes back 3 or 4 minutes later without pants in my underwear, and not just any underwear; Victorias Secret, MY VICTORIAS SECRET (only girl in the family). Ethan is laughing his ass off, Nate (next oldest brother) is rolling on the floor, and Im just sitting there like WTF.

And with my god-awful luck, my math teacher was sitting at the bench right BESIDE ME.

The teacher asks him what hes doing, and he responds with "I forgot to moisturize this morning" and puts even more on his face. The teacher asks him to go to the hall to finish his moisturizing because hes being a distraction, and after about 10 minutes he still hasnt come back in, so someone opens the door to check and hes still smearing lotion all over his face. He finally comes back in and hands the girl her lotion, and hes used up half of it. Now people call him lotion boy.', '2022-12-01 22:24:14', 'Lotion boy'),
    ('Napoleon Bonaparte', 'Okay, so this was in fourth grade, and I was in this class with all these dumbass kids. Heres the back story: My parents usually pack me fruit for a snack, but on this day they packed me like half of the leftover Pringles from the day before, you know, in that cylinder container. I was really excited since I LOVE PRINGLES. But when recess came around so I could take MY Pringles and go eat it outside, they werent in my bag. I started scoping the area, trying to find my Pringles. I call the teacher, she tries to find them but she cant either. Than this thought comes to my mind—What if MOIRA STOLE IT? Moira was this chubby girl in my class that literally ALWAYS wore this purple princess dress that should be classified as a bad Halloween costume (seriously) and was known for being a bitch. Being the judgmental 9-10 year old I was, I straight out concluded that she mustve stolen my damn Pringles. I just tell my teacher, "Well too bad, Ill just go out for recess now. It was just PRINGLES." Being a little angel. So I stomp out of the class and start searching for Moira. Im talking checking areas, finding witnesses, wasting my time. So after a solid 10 minutes, I find a group of these kids crowded at the side of one of the portable classrooms. I rush over to see what it is. The kids were eating Pringles. Barbecue flavored Pringles. MY PRINGLES. I start raging as I smack the Pringles out of the kids hands and start ripping people away from the main source. And in the middle of all the kids, sat a smug looking MOIRA with my PRINGLES. I look all mad and rip the BLOODY EMPTY CONTAINER OF PRINGLES OUT OF THE DAMN BITCHS FILTHY HANDS. By now even dumbass Moira knows whats up, shes a goner. I wouldve murdered her at the very least, but a supervisor saw us and ran over. Moira was forced to apologize and I was forced to accept her damn apology. I never got to eat my Pringles. To this day Im sure she fears my cold dead hands, ready to rip her lying face off.', '2022-12-02 02:41:00', 'I never got to eat my Pringles'),
    ('Napoleon Bonaparte', 'So one time I was home alone and it was around dinnertime when I decided to make myself something to eat. I opened the freezer and dug around until I found what appeared to be chicken nuggets in an unopened plastic bag that for some reason, didnt have any cooking instructions. Thinking that my parents must have thrown away the box for box tops, I called my mom to ask how long and at what temperature to cook chicken nuggets. She told me both of them, I laid out about 20 on a tray and stuck it in the oven, setting the timer before I walked out of the kitchen. When it was almost time to get my chicken nuggets, I walked into a cinnamon scented kitchen. I searched all over that kitchen, trying to find the cinnamon scent, leading me to the oven. I decide to turn on the oven light to see if maybe my mom had stuck some cookies in the oven and forgot to bake them, but instead, I find that the tray my chicken nuggets were on has cookies on it instead! As Im trying to process what just happened, I hear the front door open and my mom shout delightedly, "Ooooo whats that smell?" She walks into the kitchen and catches my confused expression. Thats when the spark ignited and she realized exactly what had happened. Somehow in some form, I had accidentally baked snickerdoodles.

We were in my garage spray painting the tubes and these two guys come marching up to the house across the street and start yelling at the top of their lungs, beating on the door. Now let me say in my defense the neighborhood I lived in was in south Dallas and its still not a safe place. Well I called the police, closed the garage and parked myself in front of the dining room window.

The next day at school, the teacher asked us what we had done over the weekend. Now normally I never raise my hand. But I did this time. I fucking did it this time. The worst possible time. So I raised my hand and everyone was obviously shocked to see my hand up in the air so the teacher said "yes?" and after confirming the fact that she picked me I said I saw this jelly fish in the aquarium and I thought it was really cool because it didnt have any -testacles-. and then like the classroom just emerged with so much laughter and I had no clue what was going on so I pleaded my friend to explain what was so funny I mean even THE TEACHER WAS LAUGHING AND I WAS GOING WTF. So eventually my friend explained to me (it literally took 2 hours of convincing) and then ofc I was pretty embarrassed but the thing is the fucking teacher then asked me if she could tell this to the other teachers and thats the story of how I switched schools.', '2022-12-06 08:47:23', 'Jellyfish fiasco'),

I wasnt one for playing games during class but I was soooo bored…so I searched up Pac-Man on Google and started playing (I didnt know what else to play). So I started playing and just my luck I didnt check how high my volume was….IT WAS ALL THE WAY UP. I started panicking because the game noises were excruciatingly loud.

After I had bought the drink, I opened inside target, and it exploded EVERYWHERE. The pop was at least five or six feet in diameter. I watched as people passed the mess and made looks of disgust. Imagine if I had opened it inside of the theatre…', '2022-12-13 13:56:28', 'Coca-Cola disaster'),
    ('Suleiman the Magnificent', 'Once upon a time I had a friend that was going to a Panic! At The Disco concert and she promised me she would face time me so that I could watch with her. So she messaged me at like the middle of the night telling me to answer her FaceTime call but I was at my neighbors house (which also happened to be my cousins house) so I started running out the door and my sister followed me behind and was chasing after me. She asked me where I was going so I started running as fast as I could screaming WE HAVE TO GET HOME, IM NOT GONNA MAKE IT! I NEED TO SEE, WHY CANT I SEE!?! Keep in mind that its like midnight right about now but Im running and halfway through screaming. I stepped inside a pothole in my neighbors lawn and completely fell in mud but I got right back up and kept running, muddy as hell, trying to get to my house while my sister was dying from laughter behind me. Thats not even the sad part, the sad part is my friends phone died so I just sat there with mud all over me at the dining room table staring at my blank phone just waiting. I waited for almost two hours, refusing to take a shower even though the mud was starting to dry up.

I would flush McDonalds toys I didnt want anymore or change I had found in my room. the biggest and most hilarious thing I ever dumped was a gallon of milk. one day I was bored and was looking around in the fridge low and behold there it was, a new gallon of milk. my tiny body dragged the bottle on the floor all the way to the bathroom. I opened the cap, let it go into the toilet, and flushed. I thought I was smart enough to let it go unnoticed but Ill never forget what my dad yelled out when he walked in.

My classroom was literally just around the corner from the bathroom, next to the lockers. There was a boy that I had a crush on for the past year in my class. Now for whatever reason, I was swinging my arms around in a wild half-windmill motion. Dont ask me why, I was just filled with child-like glee I guess. So there I was, swinging my arms dramatically, then just when I got to the corner… SMACK. I had accidentally slapped someone in the face. It took me a second to realize who it was: my crush. I was mortified, but he just started laughing. To this day I can probably cite that as one of my top clumsy/socially inept moments.', '2022-12-15 13:02:41', 'Slappy trails'),

I removed the various packets from the bowl, added the flavor and vegetables, then put the bowl in the microwave. After about a minute or two, I realized something was wrong. A terrible burning smell had filled my kitchen. I opened the door to my microwave and…low and behold…I had neglected to add water. There was some smoke coming from the bowl. Not wanting to waste the ramen, I went to the sink and added water, which filled the room in acrid smoke for several seconds. I then returned the bowl to the microwave and cooked it for two more minutes before attempting to eat it. Well….It went okay for a little while, until I discovered a globule of blackened noodles which had turned into some sort of strange crystalline substance yet seen in nature by humankind.

Well, flash forward to Memorial Day weekend. My family and another family went camping up in Pennsylvania for the weekend. Well, one of the days we were up there my buddy, Oliver, and I decided to take the kayaks out on the lake. Genius me, decided she wanted to listen to the 4 Selena Gomez songs I had on my phone. I thought it would be a brilliant idea to put my phone in a plastic bag to protect it from the water. When we got back from kayaking I took my phone out only to find the bag was submerged in water. We had no rice or anything to save my phone so we tried laying it out to dry, not even 15 minutes later it starts down pouring destroying my phone even more.

So this particular Saturday I was asked to help shave a clients back, which was fine its part of my job and I just needed to be professional about it and its something Ive unfortunately had to do before as well so no big deal right? wrong. So I do the usual I put on my gloves grab a razor and begin assisting the tech however much to my surprise (and displeasure) the tech suddenly pulls down the clients pants and underwear to which I am greeted with a hairy behind. It is all I can do in my power to keep from laughing from sheer shock. Ill spare you the details but lets just say it was not totally normal colored…trying to stay professional I then had to proceed and hold the clients butt cheek taunt to shave it. I finished as through and quick as I possibly could and booked it the hell out of the room.

So Im sitting in math class where our teacher makes us put our book bags against the wall to the side of the room.

I get all the way to my science class and set the book bag at my desk when LO AND BEHOLD its not my backpack. Its another ALSO RED backpack that I had mistakenly took in my rush to get to science. So I have this mini freak out at my friend Seth sitting next to me. As a freshman and quite socially inept I decide not to really do anything about it until lunch which was next block. I had some paper in my arms from last class so I decided to use those and figure out everything during lunch instead of making a scene at like literally the first week of my high school career. So we go into science class and since its the first week were always doing the scientific method lesson before anything else. My teacher asks the class for a problem we can apply to it right? Well guess who raises his hand? SETH. Now my teacher adored Seth so he gets called on and you know what his answer was?? "what if you accidentally stole someones backpack? like, you thought it was yours and you didnt mean to take it" and my teacher was like why dont you tell me more about this so Seth goes "oh its not my problem its HERS" and POINTS TO ME. Complete mortification. and even then my teacher was confused thinking I had just come up with the problem but no. only if. I hold up the stolen backpack and my teacher had the most dumbfounded look like I have never encountered someone that failed at life more than you. so he calls my math teacher yada yada I get my backpack. the worst part?
